### General Review Approach:
- Read the project's docs, specs, and whitepaper to understand what the smart contracts are meant to do.
- Construct a mental model of what you expect the contracts to look like before checking out the code.
- Do a generic line-by-line review of the contracts.
- Do another review from the perspective of every actor in the threat model.
- Glance over the project's tests + code coverage and look deeper at areas lacking coverage.
- Look at related projects and their audits to check for any similar issues or oversights.
