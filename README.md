### General Review Approach:
- Read the project's docs, specs, and whitepaper to understand what the smart contracts are meant to do.
- Construct a mental model of what you expect the contracts to look like before checking out the code.
- Do a generic line-by-line review of the contracts.
- Do another review from the perspective of every actor in the threat model.
- Glance over the project's tests + code coverage and look deeper at areas lacking coverage.
- Look at related projects and their audits to check for any similar issues or oversights.

## Standard compliance

## Math
- `M1`- Are all the roundings done in favor of the protocol to prevent any rounding vulnerability?
- `M2`- Are the multiplications done before the divisions?
- `M3`- Is the contract using a math library(e.g. `OZ::Math`) to make sure big operations don't overflow? 
- `M4`- Can any value be maliciously inflated by sending assets to the vault? 
- `M5`- If there is any entry or exit fee, is the inverse of the fee properly calculated when converting from assets to shares or vice versa?
- `M6`- If there is any decimal scalation, is it correctly done?
- `M7`- Can the vault properly handle the cases where there are zero shares, assets or even both?

## External calls
- `E1`- Does the vault properly handle reverting calls to external dependencies?
- `E2`- Is the vault susceptible to suffering a gas grieffing due to this external calls?
- `E3`- Does the vault dangerously set a fixed gas limit when doing external calls?
- `E4`- If performing raw calls, does the contract check for the `success` return value? 
- `E5`- If performing swaps, is the minimum tokens out parameter set to 0 to make sure the swaps always suceeds?
- `E6` - If the vault incurs in losses in withdrawals because of slippage in swaps, does it have some kind of TVL limit so in case all the assets need to be liquidated the slippage is not crazy?

## Share price
- `SP1`- Are `totalAssets` pesimistically accounted?
- `SP2`- Does the share price relay too much on external dependencies?  
- `SP3`- Can the share price be manipulated by either vault users or vault's external dependencies(e.g. oracle manipulation)?
- `SP4`- Is the vault share price inflation attack safe?
- `SP5`- If there is any profit lock mechanism, is it correctly reflected in the share price?

## Inheritance
- `IC1`- If the contracts inherits from `ERC4626.sol` and modifies some logic from the original implementation, does it override all of the needed functions from the inheriting for the vault to work properly?
- `IC2`- Is there any storage collision due to the inheritance?


## Tokens
- `T1`- If the vault is intended to use any token, does it properly work with fee-on-transfer or rebase tokens?
- `T2`- Can some malicious token reenter the vault? 
- `T2`- Can the contract be DoSed because an approval race conditon in the underlyig token?
- `T2`- If the vault is intended to use any token, does it use a safe transfers libary such as `OZ::SafeERC20` to safely interact with those that dont have a return value or other cases?

## Permissions and Access Control
- `P1`- Are there any constraints when it comes to fees or other values that can be set by a trusted role?
- `P2`- Can a trusted role steal funds from the vault?
- `P3` - Will users' funds be locked if the vault is paused/shutdown?
- `P4` - Do functions have a solid input validation?
- `P6` - If the funds are invested in external protocols, does the vault have some kind of emergency mode where the needed positions can be fully liquidated if neeed?


## General Security Practices
- `G1`- Does the contract try to keep the logic simple?
- `G2`- Does the contract implement battle-tested code?
- `G3`- Does the contract use a safe solidity `pragma`?
- `G4`- Do tests have a high(>=90%) code coverage?
- `G5`- If implementing external protocols, did the doing following the recommendations in the documentation?
- `G6`- Does the test suite have fuzz-tests as well?

Quick rounding checklist for ERC4626 vaults to avoid protocol loss

Round up when:
- calculating protocol fee
- calculating `assets` in `mint()` 
- calculating `shares` in `withdraw()` 

Round down when:
- calculating `shares` in `deposit()`
- calculating `assets` in `redeem()`
- implementing `convertToAssets()` and `convertToShares()` public functions
